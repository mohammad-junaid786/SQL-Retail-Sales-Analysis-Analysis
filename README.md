# 📊 Retail Sales Analysis – SQL Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes a retail sales dataset (1000 transactions) to uncover insights about **sales performance, customer behavior, product demand, and purchasing trends**.  
The dataset contains the following key columns:  
- `TransactionID`  
- `CustomerID`  
- `Gender`  
- `Age`  
- `ProductCategory`  
- `Quantity`  
- `PricePerUnit`  
- `TotalAmount`  
- `Date`  

The goal of this project is to **practice SQL for real-world analytics** by answering business-driven questions.
